    <string name="momir_message">Momir Basic is a sanctioned casual Magic Online format that is based on the "Momir Vig" Vanguard avatar.\n\nMomir Basic decks consist of the following:\n\n- Exactly 60 regular basic lands. Snow-covered basic lands are not legal in Momir Basic.\n\n- Exactly 1 Momir Vig, Simic Visionary Avatar.\n\nThe Momir Vig Avatar allows you to start with 24 life, and grants the following ability: {X}, Discard a card: Create a token that\'s a copy of a creature card with converted mana cost X chosen at random. Activate this ability only any time you could cast a sorcery and only once each turn.\n\nSomething to remember in Momir is that all the creatures are tokens, so repeatable bounce such as Nightscape Master and Sunscape Master are absolutely busted, and cards that directly interact with tokens such as Aven Wind Guide, Teysa Karlov, Emmara Tandris and Brudiclad, Telchor Engineer get exponentially better than in a regular game of Magic, while creatures that use the Transform or Morph mechanics become way worse. Also Phage the Untouchable kills you when she enters the battlefield.\n\nTo play a game of Paper Momir, you only need your deck of basic lands and this app. Press the "+" floating button in the bottom of the screen, choose a CMC and a random card will be added to the grid: That\'s the creature Momir created for you this turn.\n\nGenerally, Momir Basic games resemble Limited games where you cannot get mana screwed a lot. There\'s a lot of strategy deciding which drops to skip in order to preserve a card to drop a bigger creature later.\n\nAs of Ravnica Allegiance, the highest valid CMC is 16 and there are no 14 drop creatures, so avoid the 14 drop slot.</string>
